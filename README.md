# Sentiment-Analysis

The objective of the projcts is to compare different Machine Learning and Deep Learnign Algorithm to test their accuracy in the context of Sentimetn Analysis.

The Project Uses Django as a web Framework with Mysql As Backend.

Algorithm Used to test are : 
1. Naive Bayes 
2. LSTM
3. Descision Tree 
4. Random Forest

According to the result the accuracy of the algorithm on average goes like: LSTM > Naive Byaes > Random Forest > Descision Tree. But It may Vary with the Dataset Provided.
